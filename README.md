## 🧠 Vision
R3C redefines compiler autonomy — not to reject LLVM,  
but to prove that modern compilers can evolve **beyond it.**

- ⚙️ From legacy to safety, from safety to metal.  
- 🧩 From dependency to sovereignty.

---

## ⚖️ Governance & Neutral Position
R3C stands as an independent Rust compiler experiment,  
exploring how Rust can sustain itself beyond LLVM  
without losing compatibility or transparency.

It is **not an anti-LLVM project**, but a **resilience study** —  
a Plan-B architecture for compiler continuity.

### 🧩 Respect for LLVM and Rust Foundation  
R3C does not use or redistribute LLVM/Apple/Rust trademarks, binaries, or code.  
All work follows the MIT license and public documentation standards.

### 🧠 Open Dialogue Policy  
If any organization (LLVM, Rust Foundation, or others)  
has questions or requests about terminology or references,  
please open an Issue or contact via  
📧 0200134hjh@gmail.com for immediate review.

### 🏛️ Transparent Research  
All commits, CI logs, and release pipelines are fully public.  
Discussions are recorded through Issues and PRs for traceability.

> “We are not escaping LLVM — we are transcending it.”  
> The goal is coexistence through autonomy, not separation through conflict.
