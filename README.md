## 🧠 Vision

R3C redefines compiler autonomy — not to reject LLVM,  
but to prove that modern compilers can evolve beyond it.

> “We are not escaping LLVM — we are transcending it.”

From **legacy → safety → metal.**  
From **dependency → sovereignty.**

---

## ⚖️ Governance & Neutral Position

R3C is an **independent Rust compiler experiment**,  
studying how Rust can sustain itself beyond LLVM  
without losing compatibility or transparency.

It’s not anti-LLVM — it’s a **resilience architecture**,  
a *Plan-B* for compiler continuity.
