### ⚙️ R3C — The Rust Compiler that breathes without LLVM
If you believe in compiler independence and long-term stability,  
🌟 star this project and help shape the future of Rust sovereignty.

📦 Repository has been officially moved to r3c-foundation/r3c.

why  I  build  these:  I  want use more  stable, reliable rust.  And  i  want  to  use rust  more  consistently.

📢 **Notice — Ownershi6p Transfer Invitation**

This project is now open for **complete ownership transfer or long-term stewardship**  
to any **organization, foundation, or company** interested in maintaining and evolving it.

The goal is not abandonment, but **continuity** — ensuring that R3C’s vision of  
*LLVM-free, self-sustaining compiler design* continues under professional guidance.

> 💼 Interested parties may contact via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/0200134/r3c/issues)
> or propose collaboration under a new foundation name.

## 🧭 Overview

**R3C** is an experimental **Rust independence compiler** —  
a cross-platform transpiler that bridges **C++ → Rust → NASM**,  
proving that modern toolchains can evolve *without LLVM or Cargo*.

> 🧠 It’s not about rejecting LLVM —  
> it’s about proving that compilers can **breathe on their own.**

Key principles:
- 🧩 **Zero external dependency:** Self-contained transpilation.
- ⚙️ **Cross-language pipeline:** C++ front, Rust middle, NASM back.
- 🦋 **Self-healing:** Auto-stub generation and build repair logic.
- 🔁 **Self-hosting goal:** Future versions to compile themselves.

## ⚙️ Architecture

| Stage | Language | Role | Description |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 🧱 Core Parser | C++ | Frontend | Lexical/AST parsing for Rust |
| 🦀 Transpiler | Rust | Mid-layer | Translates C++ IR to Rust syntax trees |
| ⚙️ Assembler | NASM | Backend | Produces cross-platform x86/x64 assembly |
| 🧩 Bootstrap Tooling | Bash/Powershell | Automation | Self-repair + multi-OS build system |

## 💬 Join the Movement

> 🧠 **R3C** is a *Rust-independence experiment* — proving that a compiler can **self-build, self-repair, and self-deploy** across any platform, without relying on LLVM or Cargo.

We’re looking for contributors who love:
- 🧩 C++ systems engineering  
- ⚙️ Compiler pipelines & NASM  
- 🦀 Rust transpilation  
- 🤖 Self-healing automation

## 🪶 Vision

R3C redefines compiler autonomy — not to reject LLVM,  
but to prove that modern compilers can evolve **beyond** it.

> ⚙️ From legacy to safety, from safety to metal.  
> 🧠 From dependency to sovereignty.

## 🌿 Collaborative Branch Access

R3C allows **automatic and contributor-friendly branch creation**.

Anyone with contributor permission can open a new branch directly —  
no manual approval is needed.

To create a new branch automatically:
- Comment `/branch your-feature-name` on any issue or PR.
- The R3C automation bot will create and push the branch for you.

This system enables Rust and C++ contributors to:
- Prototype new modules
- Extend the compiler pipeline
- Experiment with IR, parser, or backend logic independently

> 💡 Example  
> `/branch rust-ffi` → creates branch `rust-ffi` automatically via GitHub Actions.

All generated branches are linked to the auto-stable CI/CD system,  
so once merged, they’re automatically included in the next **Auto Stable Release**.
