<h1 align="center">🦀 R3C — Rust Recompiler & Self-Healing Build System</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>Rust → NASM → Executable</b><br>
  ⚙️ Cross-Platform • 🤖 Self-Healing • 🧠 Autonomous Build Pipeline
</p>

---

### 🧩 Overview

R3C isn’t just another compiler.  
It’s a **Rust-independence experiment** — a self-healing, self-building system  
that compiles, repairs, and redeploys itself across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> **Goal:** Prove that a modern compiler can live without human babysitting.

---

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0200134/r3c.git
cd r3c
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/r3c --emit-asm hello.r3

> 💡 Everything builds automatically.
If something breaks, the self-heal bot creates a PR within minutes.

🤖 Self-Healing Pipeline

When a build fails, the R3C-bot triggers a full recovery:

1. Detects missing headers / invalid includes


2. Generates stubs or replacements


3. Pushes a fix branch


4. Opens a PR (auto-heal-xxxx)


5. Auto-merges once tests pass



> 🔁 Human merges are optional.
The system maintains itself.




---

🧠 Philosophy

> “Don’t build compilers that need humans.
Build compilers that build themselves.”



R3C embodies that philosophy — autonomous maintenance,
platform-agnostic builds, and minimal friction.
