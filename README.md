## 💬 Join the Movement

> 🧠 **R3C** is a *Rust-independence experiment* — proving that a compiler can **self-build, self-repair, and self-deploy** across any platform, without relying on LLVM or Cargo.

We’re looking for contributors who love:
- 🧩 C++ systems engineering  
- ⚙️ Compiler pipelines & NASM  
- 🦀 Rust transpilation  
- 🤖 Self-healing automation  

> 👉 Whether you fix one header or design a full pipeline — your contribution matters.

### 🧩 Overview

R3C isn’t just another compiler.  
It’s a **Rust-independence experiment** — a self-healing, self-building system  
that compiles, repairs, and redeploys itself across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> **Goal:** Prove that a modern compiler can live without human babysitting.

---

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0200134/r3c.git
cd r3c
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/r3c --emit-asm hello.r3

> 💡 Everything builds automatically.
If something breaks, the self-heal bot creates a PR within minutes.

⚙️ Build Status

OS	Status	Compiler	Notes

🪟 Windows		MSVC 17+	Auto-healing enabled
🐧 Ubuntu		GCC 13+	NASM pipeline active
🍎 macOS		Clang 16+	ARM64 verified



---

🤖 Self-Healing Pipeline

When a build fails, the R3C-bot triggers a full recovery:

1. Detects missing headers / invalid includes


2. Generates stubs or replacements


3. Pushes a fix branch


4. Opens a PR (auto-heal-xxxx)


5. Auto-merges once tests pass



> 🔁 Human merges are optional.
The system maintains itself.




---

🧠 Philosophy

> “Don’t build compilers that need humans.
Build compilers that build themselves.”



R3C embodies that philosophy — autonomous maintenance,
platform-agnostic builds, and minimal friction.
