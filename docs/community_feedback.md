### Welcome to r3c Discussions!
🦾 Welcome to the R3C Community
R3C isn’t just another compiler — it’s a Rust independence experiment,
built to prove that modern languages can self-host without LLVM.
This discussion space is for everyone interested in:

🧠 Bootstrapping compilers
⚙️ Cross-platform build systems (CMake, NASM, etc.)
🦀 Rust-to-NASM transpilation
💬 Debating language design and low-level architecture


🚀 What You Can Do Here

Or just say hi and tell us where you came from.


💡 Maintainer note
R3C is still early, but growing fast —
if you’re here, you’re part of the first 100 developers who discovered it 🪶
Welcome aboard.
Let’s redefine what self-hosting really means.
