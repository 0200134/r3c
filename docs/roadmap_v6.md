# 🧭 R3C Growth Roadmap v6 — Sustain & Expand Phase

**Version:** v6.0  
**Updated:** 2025-10-19  
**Maintainer:** [@0200134](https://github.com/0200134)

## 🚀 Overview

R3C has reached the *autonomous build and self-healing* stage.  
The next goal is to **sustain, expand, and open the ecosystem** for contributors and researchers.

This roadmap focuses on:
- Documentation clarity
- Contributor onboarding
- AI-Heal evolution
- Continuous visibility and engagement

---

## 🧩 Phase Goals

| # | Category | Objective | Details |
|---|-----------|------------|----------|
| **1️⃣** | **Documentation** | 📘 Create `docs/overview.md` & `r3c_architecture.md` | Explain the full Rust→NASM→Build pipeline with diagrams. Target: new devs understand within 5 minutes. |
| **2️⃣** | **AI-Heal Expansion** | 🧠 Context-aware auto repair | Move beyond missing includes — parse build logs, identify error type, and auto-patch source contextually (`heal_engine.py`). |
| **3️⃣** | **Contributor Growth** | 👥 Automated Issue Generator | Weekly creation of 3–5 beginner-friendly issues (`good first issue`, `fix-docs`, `add-example`). Encourages PR engagement. |
| **4️⃣** | **Docs Automation** | 🧾 Doxygen + Markdown Sync | Generate `/docs/api/` automatically via `docgen.cpp`. Keep README linked to API documentation. |
| **5️⃣** | **Example Expansion** | ⚙️ Real Rust→NASM samples | Add `/examples/` folder with working demos (if, while, struct). Show complete code paths. |
| **6️⃣** | **Branch Strategy** | 🌳 Four-branch workflow | main (stable), dev (active), nightly (auto-heal), and feature/* (experiment). |
| **7️⃣** | **Build Visualization** | 📊 GitHub Pages integration | Generate daily build heatmap (`docs/status.html`). Visual log of CI activity. |
| **8️⃣** | **Community Integration** | 💬 Slack/Discord alerts | Send notifications for Self-Heal PRs and merged builds → real-time transparency. |
| **9️⃣** | **Packaging** | 📦 `r3c-cli` release automation | Publish precompiled binaries to GitHub Releases for easy user install. |
| **🔟** | **Branding** | 🪲 Identity & Presentation | Add logo, banner, and tagline: *“Autonomous. Self-Healing. Cross-Platform.”* |

---

## 🕒 Timeline

| Period | Goals |
|--------|--------|
| **Short-term (1 month)** | Docs (1), AI-Heal Base (2), Examples (5) |
| **Mid-term (2–3 months)** | Branch Strategy (6), Visualization (7), Community (8) |
| **Long-term (6 months)** | Packaging (9), Branding (10), Release R3C v7.0 |

---

## 🧠 Vision

> “R3C is not a compiler — it’s an evolving organism.”  
> A system that compiles, heals, merges, and communicates on its own.

---

## 🧾 Notes

- This roadmap is **live and versioned** — it evolves as the system evolves.  
- All milestones are open to external contributors.  
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for issue creation guidelines.
