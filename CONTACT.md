# 📬 Contact — R3C Project

## 🧠 About R3C
R3C (Rust Recursive Recompiler) is an open-source experiment in compiler independence:  
> **C++ → Rust → ASM pipeline**  
> “Modern compilers must learn to breathe without LLVM.”

R3C aims to create a self-hosting, cross-platform Rust transpiler and build system  
that can function without Cargo, LLVM, or other heavyweight dependencies —  
a long-term experiment toward *Rust LTS independence*.

We welcome contact from:
- Research labs and compiler foundations  
- Corporations exploring Rust independence or embedded toolchains  
- OSS maintainers, compiler enthusiasts, and educators  

If you are evaluating R3C for research, integration, or collaboration purposes,  
please contact the maintainer directly.
